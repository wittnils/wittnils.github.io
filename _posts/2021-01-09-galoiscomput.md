We will show that the extension $$L=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3})/\mathbb{Q}$$ is galois and compute its galois group. Finally we will show that
its galois group is isomorphic to $$\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$$.

**Show it is indeed galois:** Since $$\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3}$$ are both algebraic over $$\mathbb{Q}$$ (since $$X^2-2$$ and $$X^2-3$$ are their minimal polynomials) we immediately get
that $$L/\mathbb{Q}$$ is finite, in particular it is algebraic. Since $$\mathbb{Q}$$ is a perfect field, $$L/\mathbb{Q}$$ is separable. The polynomial 
$$ f=(X^2-2)(X^2-3) \in \mathbb{Q}[X]$$
has the following roots: $$\pm \sqrt{2}, \pm\sqrt{3}$$. Therefore it splits into linear factors over $$L$$ and $$L$$ is generated by the zeroes of $$f$$. Therefore $$L/\mathbb{Q}$$ is normal. In total we get that $$L/\mathbb{Q}$$ is a finite galois extension.
